# FalloutTerminal

A replica of a typical Fallout terminal (using a terminal from Fallout 4 as a reference).
Contains the hacking mini-game along with some sample menus unlocked when hacked successfully.

I wrote this small mini-game back in 2016 as a meme ("can I make a Fallout terminal right inside my MacOS terminal??") and since then I've been keeping it in an archaic emal sent to myself.
Time to move it to the proper place.

These days, the project is a different kind of meme: it's some code I once wrote that I can no longer understand, and yet this is the script I always run first on any POSIX machine coming into my posession - a funny ritual I've been following all these years.
